# To get new certificates entirely (not just renew, don't forget to remove --staging when done testing):
# If you are adding domains, you need to also do --expand
certbot certonly --expand --webroot --webroot-path /var/www/letsencrypt --agree-tos -m aaron@openag.io --noninteractive --domains $(ls -1 /code/domains | sed 's/localhost//' | sed '/^$/d' | tr '\n' ',' | sed 's/,$//')

THEN you have to symlink proxy/dev-certs/live/<something>/*.pem to proxy/dev-certs/<domain>/.
The "<something>" above is told to you when certbot command finishes.  It is usually the 
first domain in the list.



TO RENEW ALL CERTS ONLY:
certbot renew 

THEN restart proxy:
docker-compose restart proxy
