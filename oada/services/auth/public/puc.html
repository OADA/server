              <td>Modular Choice and Consent</td>
              <td>
                The farmer has a choice to opt-out of sharing data with an
                entity or with third parties if that sharing is not the primary
                purpose of the service or product.

              <td>Third Party Audit and Certification</td>
              <td>
                An independent third party has certified that the internal
                privacy and use practices of an entity coincide with an entity’s
                stated policy, and has verified each assertion of true/false for
                these OADA principles.

              <td>Deletion of Data Upon Request</td>
              <td>
                A farmer’s data is deleted upon the farmer’s request, with
                reasonable considerations for backup and recovery services. A
                particular farmer’s contribution to aggregated data is
                impossible to delete in general once it has become
                non-identifiable, so this principle refers only to data which is
                possible to identify and delete.

              <td>
                The privacy and use policies of a given entity and the
                assertions of true/false for each of these OADA principles are
                publicly available, and their locations are properly provided as
                described in the OADA API.

              <td>Sharing of Identifiable Data with Third Parties</td>
              <td>
                A farmer explicitly controls who can see his or her data, and
                identifiable data shared with this entity is not provided to
                outside parties unless requested by the farmer. This includes
                personally identifiable data as well as geospatially
                identifiable data.

                Sharing of Anonymized or Aggregate Data with Third Parties
              </td>
              <td>
                Anonymous or aggregate data are not shared with third parties
                unless requested by the farmer.

              <td>Internal Guidelines for Data Access</td>
              <td>
                A company has internal policies which limit access to farmer
                data to only those individuals and uses necessary to properly
                provide a farmer with a given service.

              <td>Access and Transferability</td>
              <td>
                A farmer and his authorized agents are not intentionally denied
                access to the farmer’s data, and the farmer can transfer his or
                her data from a service at any time.

                All data generated for a farmer is available to that farmer in a
                publicly published format.
